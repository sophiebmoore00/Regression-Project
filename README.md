# Regression-Project

This project was completed for a Regression Analysis course. It uses data on the literacy rates of all US counties and potential predictors to fit a multiple regression model that accurately predicts literacy rates. 

I collaborated with Eliza Jacobson on this project for the planning, writing, and some of the statistical analysis, however I was the leader of our group and wrote all of the R code. 

This project was an incredible learning opportunity that I used to not only learn more about regression analysis, but also to improve upon my own ability to use R Markdown for formal projects and become much more familiar with formatting and style elements.
